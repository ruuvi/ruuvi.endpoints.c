# Embedding to your application
Include a tagged release to your application as a git submodule.
If you define `APPLICATION_ENDPOINTS_CONFIGURED` in preprocessor, you can select which endpoints to compile by adding
definitions `#define RE_3_ENABLED 1` , `#define RE_5_ENABLED 1`  etc in "app_config.h" inside your application.

# Developing
## Unit testing
Unit tests are run by Ceedling.

## Static code analysis
Test coverage and code analysis are reported by [Sonarcloud](https://sonarcloud.io/dashboard?id=ruuvi.endpoints.c). Additionally the project is analyzed with PVS Studio and report is published to [GH Pages](https://ruuvi.github.io/ruuvi.endpoints.c/fullhtml)

### SonarQube for IDE (VS Code)
To enable C/C++ analysis in VS Code with SonarQube for IDE, generate a compilation database:
```bash
ls src/*.c | while read f; do echo "{\"directory\": \"$(pwd)\", \"file\": \"$f\", \"command\": \"gcc -c $f -I./src\"}"; done | jq -s '.' > compile_commands.json
```
The VS Code settings are pre-configured to use this file.

## Styling
Styling is done via Artisitic Style, following configuration at .astylerc. 

## Documentation
Documentation is autogenerated to [GH-Pages](https://ruuvi.github.io/ruuvi.endpoints.c/).
On pull requests, the documentation is generated to gh-pages-check branch.

## Customization for private projects

Use 0xF0 ... 0xFF space for custom header and type bytes. With the exception of 0xFA-header adveertisement, Ruuvi does not have official uses which start
with these headers. This way future Ruuvi development won't conflict with your development.
