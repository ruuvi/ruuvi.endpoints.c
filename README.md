# Embedding to your application
Include a tagged release to your application as a git submodule.
If you define `APPLICATION_ENDPOINTS_CONFIGURED` in preprocessor, you can select which endpoints to compile by adding
definitions `#define RE_3_ENABLED 1` , `#define RE_5_ENABLED 1`  etc in "app_config.h" inside your application.

# Developing

## Customization for private projects

Use 0xF0 ... 0xFF space for custom header and type bytes. With the exception of 0xFA-header adveertisement, Ruuvi does not have official uses which start
with these headers. This way future Ruuvi development won't conflict with your development.
